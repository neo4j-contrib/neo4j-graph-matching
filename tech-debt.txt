[2010-02-09] Refactor for coherency
    The main part of this component is made out of the graphmatching package
    then there is the graphmathing.filter package that is bolted on ontop of
    the graphmatching package. This should be refactored so that the entire
    module feels like a coherent thing.

[2010-02-09] Testing missig for the filter package
    The filter package was created in a rush without tests.
    This needs to be rectified.

[2010-02-09] Developer documentation missing
    This component need documentation on how the matching works, so that
    another developer can pick things up and take this component further.

[2010-02-09] User documentation missing
    There needs to be good examples of how to use the graph matching component
    as well as documentation on how to set up a pattern and execute the matcher.
